### ⚠️ **Important Note**

**🚨 As the deployment of the HyperLane bridge is done on the cloud Kurtosis free plan, the cross-chain calls won't work after 2nd july 11.30 pm. Please refer to the demo video for more information. 🚨**

# [Payroll Protocol](https://t.me/payrollprotocolbot)

**Payroll Protocol** is a confidential money distribution platform built on top of BASE, designed to provide confidentiality during the distribution of funds on-chain. By leveraging FHE cryptography and smart contracts, Payroll Protocol ensures the **confidentiality**, security, and efficiency of money distribution.

## Overview

Payroll Protocol integrates **BICONOMY AA SDK, BASE, and INCO FHEVM** to enhance user experience while confidentially distributing money.

INCO FHEVM provides hidden states to store encrypted addresses that hold encrypted amounts on the INCO network, ensuring that all **transactions are secure and confidential**. This integration guarantees that money distribution details and recipient information remain confidential. It uses **modified Hyperlane infrastructure** to bridge these state values from BASE to INCO and vice versa.

## Key Features

1. **Encrypted USDC Distributions:** Protects sensitive information with robust encryption methods.
2. **User-Friendly Interface:** Simplifies the payroll process with one click, thanks to BICONOMY SDK.
3. **Stealth Hold:** Users can hold stablecoins for an indefinite amount of time without revealing the amount.
4. **Underline Distribution:** Users can completely hide their withdrawals by distributing the encrypted amount to different encrypted addresses on their behalf, providing an experience similar to Tornado Cash.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Authentication & Wallets:** Privy

## TFHE functions examples: 
```javascript
      mapping(eaddress => euint32) private ownerToBalance;

    // Encrypt a plaintext address to eaddress
    function encryptAddress(address plainAddress) public returns (eaddress) {
        return asEaddress(plainAddress);
    }

      function decryptAddress(eaddress _eAddress) public view returns (address) {
        // Decrypt the encrypted address
        return TFHE.decrypt(_eAddress);
    }

    function encryptAmount(uint32 amount) public view returns (euint32) {
        // Decrypt the encrypted address
        return TFHE.asEuint32(amount);
    }

     function decryptAmount(euint32 encryptedAmount) public view returns (uint32) {
        // Decrypt the encrypted address
        return TFHE.decrypt(encryptedAmount);
    }
```
